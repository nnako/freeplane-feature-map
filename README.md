Freeplane Feature Map
---------------------



Scope
-----

This feature map is intended to help users find their way through all the features of the world greatest open source mind mapping tool Freeplane ;-) . As many features have been developed and are currently under development, it sometimes becomes hard to keep all these features in mind (or have a structured but detailed overview) and find feature-specific answers to user relevant questions. Thus, this feature map covers the following areas:

- display the richness of Freeplane on one sheet of "paper"
- overview of development state of user relevant features
- linking of features with forum discussion topics
- linking of features with usage documentations
- outlook documentation on features to come in future releases
- enable easy comparison to other mindmapping tools
- spot which developers are currently working on which features
- connect features with their respective version information
- ...



Usage
-----

This feature map is to be updated by Freeplane's developers as the development status changes for respective features or new features are created. The map will be exported into a JAVA applet and mapped within Freeplane's WIKI on the sourceforge development platform. Users can then view, browse, filter and search the map in order to find useful information and links to detailed sources. But of course, any user could download the map from here (GitHub) and use it as a normal mindmap or use the predefined styles as a template for own feature development documentation.



Engineering
-----------

This feature map can be viewed and edited using the Freeplane mindmap editor, downloadable from the Freeplane project page on sourceforge. Any Freeplane developer is free and encouraged to contribute to this feature map in order to complete its information and adjust its structure where necessary. In order to keep this map as structured and as informative as possible, please:

1. try to keep the categories right ; add category items if necessary
![choose categories](http://www11.pic-upload.de/06.09.14/78mk1a5nv5e1.gif)

2. use the appropriate style for your feature development status classification
![use styles](http://www11.pic-upload.de/06.09.14/1i7k7tkcu63e.gif)

3. add attributes for links with forum discussion, documentation, ...
![add attributes](http://www11.pic-upload.de/06.09.14/7hmq8lmx1r82.gif)

4. hyperlink feature with other places in this map, when appropriate
![use hyperlinks](http://www11.pic-upload.de/06.09.14/xj7lrqdbg37.gif)
